            As a determined person with a goal towards which I am working, and a passion for Technology, I've had quite an experience in the 
            field of work. I've had the opportunity to intern with <a href="https://www.samaragroup.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            <strong>Samara Company  Ltd.</strong></a> for quite a number of times. After high school in 2018, I interned with the Company
            as a sales personnel/supervisor till I got an admission to Ashesi University in that same year. While in Ashesi, I also interned 
            with <a href="https://www.samaragroup.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Samara Company  Ltd.</strong></a> in the 
            <em>IT Department</em> where I did some <em>Data Entry</em> and also <em>Employee Assistant; thus attended to workers who needed 
            help with any issue regarding their PC.</em>
