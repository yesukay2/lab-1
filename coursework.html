            One thing I love about Ashesi University is their choice of educational system, thus, the <em>liberal art system.</em> 
            In my case for instance, I am majoring in Computer Science but the educational system used in the school requires me 
            to take some courses that are not directly related to Computer Science, but at the same time I am achieving an 
            in-depth knowledge in Computer Science. This type of educational system always reminds me of my version of a very common phrase 
            <em>jack of many, master of one</em>. But for now, i will just list only the Computer Science related coursework.
