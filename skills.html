            As a <em>Computer Science</em> student, I have learnt a couple of programming languages overtime. Below is a list:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>C/C++</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>R</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I have had the opportunity to learn these programming languages over a period of two years, 
            I find it reasonable and efficient to focus on one particular programming language. Some people may 
            find this statement arguable but my reason for that kind of decision is that, if you try to learn all (or more than 3) 
            the programming languages at a time (without ofcourse having the brain of a super genius), everything jams up in 
            your mind, making you unable to gain deep knowledge for all. Rather if you focus on at most two (but at best one) 
            programming language,then you can gain a very deep knowledge and more experience in that particular language. 
            For this reason,I chose to focus on Java and HTML.
