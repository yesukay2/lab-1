                            During the second semester of my second year, I aspired for the position of a Judicial Electoral Council (JEC) 
                            Class Representative and succeeded in becoming one. As a JEC class rep, my main function is to be the mouth of 
                            my class in any JEC relation issue/meeting. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I also play in the school soccer league in a team called League Of Legends(LOL). I have been in that same team since
                            my first year when I joined the school.

                            I also like to play Table Tennis with my mates during some free times.
