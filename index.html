            <p>
                I am a student of <em>Ashesi University</em> where I am currently studying <em>Computer Science.</em> 
                I was enrolled into Ashesi University in the year 2018 where I am studying to gain a 
                <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science by the year 2022.</strong> I have a great interest in the 
                field of Technology but i'm looking forward to achieving a <strong>Masters degree in Web Development</strong> 
                since it is one of the top developing field of Tech with <em>great demamd</em> in this modern day and age.
                I was born and raised in Ghana, in the Brong Ahafo Region. I am always happy to say that I'm a proud Ghanaian.
