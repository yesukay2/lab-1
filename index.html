        <p>
            I am a student of <em>Ashesi University</em> where I am currently studying <em>Computer Science.</em> 
            I was enrolled into Ashesi University in the year 2018 where I am studying to gain a 
            <strong>Degree in Computer Science by the year 2022.</strong> I have a great interest in the 
            field of Technology but i'm looking forward to achieving a <strong>Masters degree in Web Development</strong> 
            since it is one of the top developing field of Tech with <em>great demamd</em> in this modern day and age.
            I was born and raised in Ghana, in the Brong Ahafo Region. I am always happy to say that I'm a proud Ghanaian.
