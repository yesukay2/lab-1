            <p>In most of my programming courses, I am required to do at least one project. I'll list a few of them for now:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Database Project:</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Horse Rental Company:<br> With this project, I solely used SQL to build a database program that stores
                        data from a company that deals in horse rental. The program stores the information of every emploee in 
                        the company. It also stores the details of every vehicle in the company. The program was aimed at solving 
                        the problem of having to keep a written log in a horse rental company. It keeps track of the movement of every 
                        employee and the vehicles in the company and keep record of the rental services provided. 
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Illegal Minning Project:</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Galamsey Monitor:<br> In a  team of 4 in my Second Year, we built a program that basically tracks the conditions of lands with respect to 
                        <em>Illegal Minning</em> in various regions  in Ghana. The program allows user to input the <em>latitude and longitude</em> 
                        for the location they are and select a colour code for the current condition of the land (Green :Healthy Vegetation with no 
                        "galamsey", Yellow :Fair Vegetation with Potential "Galamsey", Brown :Poor Vegetation with "Galamsey")
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <strong> Employee Exeact System:</strong>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Exeat:<br> Currently, I am working on an exeat system for a company. This system will be built in such a way that anytime
                        any employee wants to go out of the working premise/office, he/she must be logged into  a system that will send a 
                        message to the security post system and serve as a pass for the  employee. This programs is going to be made in such a
                        such a way that a <em>higher ranking member</em> of the company will have to approve any logged request.
                    </p>
                </ul>
